This is my personal reposistory for things that I package. It's intended
primarily to publish software from other open source projects that otherwise
do not package their software at all or in a way I like.

I primarily package things for the latest LTS and latest non-LTS versions of
Ubuntu, as long as it's compatible with currently supported Kubernetes
versions. Other things may be present in this repository but they may not be
actively maintained.
