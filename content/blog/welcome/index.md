I will be working on this site over the next few weeks to see what I can
incorporate into it. This is both for my own purposes and to investigate
how well [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) 
fit into other projects.

Specifically I'm aiming to accomlish the following things: 

- Automate documentation of my APT Repository

- Make some general documentation around my Kubernetes setup

- Implement some specific things that I've seen elsewhere

  - Latest blog post on the site index
